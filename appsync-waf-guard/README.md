# Welcome to talkncloud CDK TypeScript project!

This example was developed to provide a working run through of cloudformation guard (cfn-guard)!

**WAIT! This project is a clone of the original project, this is simply to demo cfn-guard and is NOT a working example for AppSync, please use original**
